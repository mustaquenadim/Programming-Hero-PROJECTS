# Let's Ride

This is a available transport website. But it is not completely dynamic. You can say it's a dummy website using React.

## 1 `React Router`

In this project, I've used react-router.

### 1.1 `React Private Route`

I've also used react private route i.e. protected route. It will stop you to visit protected route without sign in.

## 2 `React Bootstrap`

I've used react-bootstrap to make my site responsive for Mobile-UI and Desktop-UI.

## 3 `Font Awesome`

You can see a few icons in this site. I've used these icons by the help of font-awesome.
